# Image-Processing-Functions
A collection of various important image processing functions.

I implemented these functions in order to attain a deeper understanding of digital image processing.

All of these functions are implemented in Python with the following libraries:
<ul>
  <li>numpy</li>
  <li>skimage (for I/O only)</li>
  <li>cv2 (for I/O only)</li> 
</ul>

We represent grayscale/RGB images as 2D/3D arrays from NumPy and utilize the many mathematical functions that
NumPy provides to manipulate the images.
